# Streaming vs. Complete Generation

LocoLama supports two modes of text generation when interacting with local LLMs through Ollama: streaming and complete generation. This document explains the differences between these modes and their trade-offs.

## Complete Generation

By default, LocoLama uses complete generation, which means:

1. You send a message
2. The entire response is generated before being displayed
3. You see the full response all at once

### Advantages of Complete Generation

- **Simpler Implementation**: Easier to implement and handle on the frontend
- **Consistent UI**: No partial updates or flickering as text appears
- **Better for Copying**: The full response is immediately available for copying

### Disadvantages of Complete Generation

- **Longer Perceived Wait Time**: You don't see any response until the entire generation is complete
- **No Early Stopping**: You must wait for the full generation even if the first part already answers your question
- **Higher Memory Usage**: The entire response must be held in memory before being displayed

## Streaming Generation

Streaming generation (which can be enabled in the API route) works differently:

1. You send a message
2. The model starts generating the response and sends it token by token
3. You see the response appear gradually in real-time, similar to how ChatGPT displays responses

### Advantages of Streaming Generation

- **Faster Perceived Response**: You see the beginning of the response immediately
- **Early Stopping Potential**: You could potentially stop generation once you have the information you need
- **More Interactive Feel**: Creates a more dynamic, conversational experience
- **Lower Peak Memory Usage**: Tokens are processed and displayed as they arrive

### Disadvantages of Streaming Generation

- **More Complex Implementation**: Requires handling streaming responses on both backend and frontend
- **Potential UI Flicker**: The UI may update rapidly as new tokens arrive
- **Harder to Copy Partial Responses**: Users might try to copy before generation is complete

## Technical Implementation

In LocoLama, the streaming vs. complete generation mode is controlled in the API route:

```typescript
// In pages/api/chat.ts
// To use streaming:
const stream = true;

// To use complete generation:
const stream = false;
```

The Ollama client supports both modes through the `stream` parameter in the API request.

## Performance Considerations

- **Complete Generation**: May have higher latency before any response is shown, but potentially faster overall completion time
- **Streaming Generation**: Lower latency for initial response, but might have slightly higher overall completion time due to the overhead of streaming

## Choosing the Right Mode

For most casual chat interactions, streaming generation provides a better user experience because it gives immediate feedback. However, for applications where the complete and formatted response is important (like code generation), complete generation might be preferable.

LocoLama currently uses complete generation by default, but the code includes comments and infrastructure to support streaming in future updates.
